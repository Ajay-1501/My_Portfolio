                Augmented reality in construction using BIM Technology

                One of the major industries in the world is construction diligence. Since the first begin in the history of construction assiduity, there has been significant transformation. Augmented and virtual reality are contributing to an incredible revision and advancement in colourful construction concerns among the myriad changes. The main goal of this study is to examine the improvements in construction efficiency brought about by augmented reality and augmented reality technology, 
                as well as their contribution to resolving diverse construction difficulties during the past few decades. The study has shown that these unbelievable developments in AR and VR technology are significantly affecting construction diligence in a number of ways. This study demonstrates a vibrant application of VR and AR technologies. In the ultramodern building process, reality is employed for design scheduling and design progress shadowing. AR and VR are tested technologies for efficient and less time-consuming communication between various design actors. 
                Additionally helpful robotic solutions for quality and illumination in construction design are AR and VR.
